I am a faculty member at School of Computing at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University, Amritapuri Campus, Kerala, India. I am interested in designing efficient, or approximation algorithms  for combinatorial optimizations problems.

I did my PhD form Amrita University in the year 2022. I consider myself very fortunate to have been advised by <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~chalam/">Dr Bhadrachalam Chitturi</a>  , University of Texas at Dallas, and <a href="https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/rajans/">Dr Rajan Sundaravaradhan</a>, Amrita University, Inida.
