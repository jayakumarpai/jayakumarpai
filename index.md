I am a faculty member at School of Computing at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University, Amritapuri Campus, Kerala, India. I am interested in designing efficient, or approximation algorithms  for combinatorial optimizations problems.

I did my PhD form Amrita University in the year 2022. I have been very fortunate to have been advised by Dr Bhadrachalam Chitturi, University of Texas at Dallas, and Dr Rajan Sundaravaradhan, Amrita University, Inida.
